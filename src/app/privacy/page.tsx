          Reading this privacy policy will help you make informed decisions

        </p>
        <h2>1. What information do we collect?</h2>
        <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
        <p>
          In line with our commitment to privacy, we do NOT collect any personal
          information from the data you voluntarily provide to us when
          expressing interest in obtaining information about us or our products
          and services, or participating in activities on the Services. However,
          we do collect anonymized data, which does not disclose your specific
          identity (such as your name or contact information) but may include
          information you share with us when participating in activities on the
          Services. This information is used to enhance our products and
          services, including storage, analysis, and sharing of anonymized
          standalone and/or aggregated data. We do not intentionally collect any
          personal data from our users. Although we strive to avoid collecting
          personal information, it may inadvertently be encountered temporarily,
          which we then expunge through regular monitoring. No personal
          information will be disclosed through our Service.
        </p>
        <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
        Certain information is collected automatically when you visit, use, or
        navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific
        identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device
        and usage data, such as your browser and device characteristics,
        operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name,
        country, location, and details on how and when you use our Services,
        along with other technical information. This data is essential for
        maintaining the security and operation of our Services, as well as for
        our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
        <br />
        Like many businesses, we gather information through cookies and similar
        technologies.
        <br />
        **Online Identifiers:** We collect identifiers from cookies or other
        tracking mechanisms used for analytics and marketing purposes, among
        other similar data.
        <h2>2. How do we use your information?</h2>
        <p>
          We employ the personal information collected through our Services for
          various business purposes as described below. We process your personal
          information based on our legitimate business interests, to fulfill a
          contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our
          legal obligations. Next to each purpose, we note the specific
          processing grounds we rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use your information for other Business Purposes, such as data
          analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of
          our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our Services,
          products, marketing, and your experience. We may use and store this
          information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not
          associated with individual end-users and does not include personal
          information. We will not use identifiable personal information without
          your consent.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Will your information be shared with anyone?</h2>
        <p>
          We only share personal information with your consent, to comply with
          laws, provide you with services, protect your rights, or fulfill
          business obligations. We may process or share data based on the
          following legal basis:

            the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in
            litigation in which we are involved.

            Services over time. This information may be used to analyze and
            track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better
            understand online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do
            not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your information with third
            parties for their promotional purposes. Our contracts with data
            processors ensure that they cannot do anything with your personal
            information unless we have instructed them to do so. They will not
            share your personal information with any organization apart from us.
            They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.

          We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and

        </p>
        <h2>6. How long do we keep your information?</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary for
          the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless a longer
          retention period is mandated or allowed by law. When we have no
          ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
          it is either deleted or anonymized. If deletion is not feasible, such
          as when your information is within backup archives, we securely store
          and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>
        <h2>7. How do we keep your information safe?</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to safeguard your personal information with a system of
          organizational and technical security measures. While we aim to ensure
          the security of any information we process, no method of transmission
          over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Accessing
          services within a secure environment is recommended.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Do we collect information from minors?</h2>
        <p>
          SwipeStats.io does not knowingly collect data from or market to
          individuals under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
          represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or
          guardian of a minor and consent to the minor&apos;s use of the
          Services. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal
          information from users under 18, we will deactivate the account and
          promptly delete the data from our records. Please contact us at
          privacy@swipestats.io if you are aware of any data we have collected
          from minors under 18.
        </p>
        <h2>9. What are your privacy rights?</h2>
        <p>
          In certain regions, like the European Economic Area, you have rights
          under data protection laws, including the right to access, request
          correction or deletion, restrict processing, and, if applicable, data
          portability. In certain circumstances, you may also object to the
          processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights,
          please contact us using the details provided below. Consent-based
          processing of personal information can be withdrawn at any time,
          though this will not affect processing prior to the withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies and similar technologies: Most web browsers accept cookies by
          default. You can usually modify your browser settings to reject
          cookies if you prefer. This may impact certain features or services of
          our Services. For opting out of cookies on our Service, adjust your
          cookie settings.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers, mobile operating systems, and mobile applications
          include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting. Since
          there is no standardized approach to recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals, we currently do not respond to them. If an online tracking
          standard we must follow arises, we will inform you about that practice
          in a revised version of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Do California residents have specific privacy rights?</h2>
        <p>
          California residents have specific rights regarding their personal
          information. The &quot;Shine The Light&quot; law allows California
          users to request and obtain information about personal information
          disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes once a year.
          If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request,
          please submit it in writing using the contact information provided
          below.
        </p>

          removal of unwanted publicly posted data. To request such removal,
          contact us with the associated email address and a statement that you
          reside in California. We will ensure the data is not publicly
          displayed, but it may not be comprehensively removed from our systems.

          The updated version will be indicated by an updated
          &quot;Revised&quot; date and will be effective upon posting. We will
          notify you of significant changes by posting a notice or direct
          communication. Frequent review of this privacy policy is encouraged.
